Project Description
===================

Run Samurai, Run! is a top-down 2D infinite side scrolling runner game for mobile devices where the user will be able to take control 
of a small ninja and run and fight through mobs of enemies. The user has the choice between avoiding the enemies in the game or attacking 
them for rewards and upgrades, since the game will scale in difficulty it would not be advised for the player to avoid all the enemies he/she 
sees since these upgrades will be essential for record-beating runs. The game will have 2 game modes, single player and head to head multiplayer, 
for single player is the base game with the infinite running and leaderboards. Head to head is our multiplayer implementation of the game with a 
time limit and different methods of upgrading and scoring. You will compete 1 on 1 vs one of your friends or a random online player, the player 
who is able to gain the highest score (by staying alive the longest or by slaying enemies) will be crowned winner. A possible addition for this 
mode would be a compensation system for players including unlockables and cosmetic items which would pair along well with a character creation system, 
leaving every individual character design unique.


 GIT RULES
===========

1. All work shall be done in the development branch of the git.
2. No pushing broken code, always test before commiting and pushing.
3. We save all working demos (snapshots) to the master branch, that way if code ever get irrepairably broken we have a working snapshot to revert to.
    These will be starting to be saved after we have finalized versions of our application, when adding new feature we revert back to the development branch.
4. Code Review: It would be nice if we code review with each other before making big changes and pushing.
5. Keep naming convensions relevant and document your code before pushing, we need to all be able to understand what is going on in everyones code:) 
    (In-line comments are appreciated)
6. Use tabs not spaces.
7. Camelcase naming convensions only, underscores are ugly.
